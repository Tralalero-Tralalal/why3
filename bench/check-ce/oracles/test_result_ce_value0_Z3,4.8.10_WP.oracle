Sub-goal Assertion of goal test2'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (sat) (187 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File test_result_ce_value0.mlw:
  Line 6:
    x = 0
    x = 0
    Execution of main function `test2` with env:
      { lsenv = []; vsenv = [ x = 0 ]; rsenv = []; idenv = [] }
  Line 7:
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function `id` with args:
      [ x = 0 ]
    result of `id` = 42
  Line 8:
    Property failure at assertion with env:
      { lsenv = []; vsenv = [ x = 0, a = 42 ]; rsenv = [];
        idenv = [ a = 42 ] }
