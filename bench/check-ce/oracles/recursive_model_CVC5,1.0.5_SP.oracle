File "bench/check-ce/recursive_model.mlw", line 11, characters 21-26:
Sub-goal Assertion of goal test'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown + incomplete) (414 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File recursive_model.mlw:
  Line 6:
    global = (S Z)
  Line 8:
    i = (- 1)
    i = (- 1)
    Execution of main function `test` with env:
      { lsenv = []; vsenv = [ global = (S Z), i = (- 1) ]; rsenv = [];
        idenv = [] }
  Line 10:
    Property failure at assertion with env:
      { lsenv = []; vsenv = [ global = (S Z), i = (- 1) ]; rsenv = [];
        idenv = [ Z = UNDEFINED, global = (S Z), i = (- 1) ] }
