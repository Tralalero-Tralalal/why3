Sub-goal Postcondition of goal f'vc.
Prover result is: Unknown (unknown) (10 steps).
The program does not comply to the verification goal, for example during the
  following execution:
File return_value_below_if_when_vc_sp.mlw:
  Line 6:
    b = true
    y = 42
    b = true
    y = 42
    Execution of main function `f` with env:
      { lsenv = []; vsenv = [ b = true, y = 42 ]; rsenv = []; idenv = [] }
  Line 8:
    (giant-step) execution of unimplemented function `bool_neq` with args:
      [ x = 42, y = 0 ]
    result of `bool_neq` = true
  Line 7:
    Property failure at postcondition of `f` with env:
      { lsenv = []; vsenv = [ b = true, y = 42, result = true ]; rsenv = [];
        idenv = [ True = UNDEFINED, b = true, y = 42, result = true ] }
